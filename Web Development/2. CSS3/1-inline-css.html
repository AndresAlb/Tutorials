    <!--You can include CSS into your document by using the "style"
    attribute within your tags like so:

        <tag style="{css goes here}"></tag>

    This is called "inline CSS". Inline CSS is good for styling very
    small projects that include very little code, but it isn't great
    when projects get bigger and have more elements
